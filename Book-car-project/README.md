# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

"Rent Car" is a React.js web app for car rentals with smooth navigation and intuitive icons.

How to Load the page:
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the command npm install to install the project dependencies.
4. After the installation is complete, execute npm run dev to start the development server.
5. Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to the specified URL (usually http://localhost:3000) to view the application.
